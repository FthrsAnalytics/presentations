# Financial Statements with DAX in Power BI

Do you want to push the envelope of your visual reports? Do you need to visualize data beyond the default options included in Power BI? Utilizing the power of R visuals allow you to create more flexible and stunning reports.

This session will begin with a high level introduction to R and how to use R scripts as a data source. The advantages and limitations of leveraging R within Power BI will be covered throughout. Then, the fun part: developing R visuals within Power BI Desktop!

1. How to create a data model from across multiple sources
2. How to build a customizable mapping file that provides a bespoke view of the financials
3. How to create DAX measures in a step-by-step fashion to populate the body of the report.

To view the Power BI report, open `R Visuals in Power BI.pbix` with Power BI Desktop. You will have to update the file_path parameter to reference the location of your source files.

For the R Scripts, ensure you have an R environment (I use RStudio) with necessary libraries installed.
