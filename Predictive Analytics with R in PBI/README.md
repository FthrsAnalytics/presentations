# Predictive Analytics with R in Power BI

Power BI reports are typically used for descriptive analysis: a historical look of what has happened. But what if your report could visualize what is likely to happen and recommend what you can do about it now?

This session will cover how to shift from descriptive to predictive analysis and leverage the power of machine learning to enhance your business intelligence solutions. The basics and best practices of predictive modeling will be introduced, and these concepts will be applied to create three predictive models in R using three different techniques. We will then walk through the three different ways to integrate the predictive power of these models into a Power BI report.

## Contents

- `slides`: Contains the PowerPoint slides (`Predictive Analytics with R in Power BI.pptx`).
- `reports`: Includes the Power BI report (`Predictive Analytics with R in Power BI.pbix`).
- `data`: Source files (`Excel Source Data.xlsx`).
- `scripts`: Analysis scripts (`4 scripts: the demo R Script and the 3 models that are integrated in Power BI`).

## Usage

To view the Power BI report, open `Predictive Analytics with R in Power BI.pbix` with Power BI Desktop. You will have to update the file_path parameter to reference the location of your source files.

For the R Scripts, ensure you have an R environment (I use RStudio) with necessary libraries installed.
