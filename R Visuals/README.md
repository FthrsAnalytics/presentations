# R Visuals

Do you want to push the envelope of your visual reports? Do you need to visualize data beyond the default options included in Power BI? Utilizing the power of R visuals allow you to create more flexible and stunning reports.

This session will begin with a high level introduction to R and how to use R scripts as a data source. The advantages and limitations of leveraging R within Power BI will be covered throughout. Then, the fun part: developing R visuals within Power BI Desktop!

## Contents

- `slides`: Contains the PowerPoint slides (`R Visuals in Power BI.pptx`).
