# R Visuals

Do you want to push the envelope of your visual reports? Do you need to visualize data beyond the default options included in Power BI? Utilizing the power of R visuals allow you to create more flexible and stunning reports.

This session will begin with a high level introduction to R and how to use R scripts as a data source. The advantages and limitations of leveraging R within Power BI will be covered throughout. Then, the fun part: developing R visuals within Power BI Desktop!

## Contents

- `slides`: Contains the PowerPoint slides (`presentation_1.pptx`).
- `reports`: Includes the Power BI report (`report_1.pbix`).
- `data`: Source files (`datafile.csv`, `dataset.xlsx`).
- `scripts`: Analysis scripts (`analysis.R`, `notebook.ipynb`).

## Usage

To view the Power BI report, open `report_1.pbix` with Power BI Desktop. For the R Scripts, ensure you have an R environment (I use RStudio) with necessary libraries installed.
