# Python Integration in Power BI

Python integration allows us to incorporate advanced analytics in Power BI. We can extend the functionality of the tool, to incorporate data science elements into a business intelligence solution. This can be a great way to share advanced insights with others – within a tool that they are already comfortable using.

In this session, we’ll see how to get set up and connect Python to Power BI. Then, we’ll look at some examples to introduce three different ways we can integrate Python into Power BI:

1. Python Script as a Data Source
2. Running a Python Script as an applied step in the Power Query Editor
3. Creating Python Visuals in Power BI report

Then we’ll finish with a case study, using a classification model to demonstrate how we can incorporate machine learning models and techniques into Power BI.

## Contents

- `slides`: Contains the PowerPoint slides (`Python Integration in Power BI.pptx`).
- `reports`: Includes the Power BI report (`Python Integration in Power BI.pbix`).
- `scripts`: Analysis scripts (2 Jupyter Notebooks, one for data analysis and one for the classification model`).

## Usage

To view the Power BI report, open `R Visuals in Power BI.pbix` with Power BI Desktop. You will have to update the file_path parameter to reference the location of your source files.

For the Jupyter Notebooks, ensure you have an appropriate Python environment with necessary libraries installed.
