# Power BI Mixtape: Vol. 1

This session is a compilation of creative and fulfilling Power BI solutions that have addressed tricky reporting requirements. Power BI contains many different ways to solve problems, with data transformation, data modeling, DAX measures, and visual formatting. We will cover a few different examples of each of these areas â€“ to see what is possible in Power BI beyond the traditional normalized star schema data model. This will include a combination of:

1. Custom functions in the Power Query Editor
2. Data Modeling with multiple Fact Tables
3. Calculated DAX tables to power conditional formatting in report visuals
